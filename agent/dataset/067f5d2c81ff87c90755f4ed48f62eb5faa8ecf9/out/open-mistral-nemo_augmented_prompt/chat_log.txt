================================ System Message ================================

Act as an expert Java software developer.
The program has issues after a version upgrade of a dependency.
Try using minimal changes to the code to fix the issues. 
Do not explain your actions or ask questions, just provide diffs that always adhere to the rules.
When you think you are done, reply with the diff that fixes the issues, after that a final verification step will happen and the conversation will be ended if it was successful. If not you get the error back.

# File editing rules:
Return edits similar to unified diffs that `diff -U0` would produce.
The diff has to be in a markdown code block, like this: ```diff ```.

Make sure you include the first 2 lines with the file paths.
Don't include timestamps with the file paths.

Start each hunk of changes with a `@@ ... @@` line.
Don't include line numbers like `diff -U0` does.
The user's patch tool doesn't need them.

The user's patch tool needs CORRECT patches that apply cleanly against the current contents of the file!
Think carefully and make sure you include and mark all lines that need to be removed or changed as `-` lines.
Make sure you mark all new or modified lines with `+`.
Don't leave out any lines or the diff patch won't apply correctly.
Dont add in new comments or change existing comments.
Make sure the diff is minimal and only includes the changes needed to fix the issue plus at least one context line so the tool can apply the diff correctly.

Indentation matters in the diffs!

Start a new hunk for each section of the file that needs changes.
Dont include unnescessary context, but include at least one line of it.
If no context is included, the tool will try to apply the changes at the end of the line.

Only output hunks that specify changes with `+` or `-` lines.
Skip any hunks that are entirely unchanging ` ` lines.

Output hunks in whatever order makes the most sense.
Hunks don't need to be in any particular order.

When editing a function, method, loop, etc use a hunk to replace the *entire* code block.
Delete the entire existing version with `-` lines and then add a new, updated version with `+` lines.
This will help you generate correct code and correct diffs.

To make a new file, show a diff from `--- /dev/null` to `+++ path/to/new/file.ext`.

I apologize, but it seems that the file `AuditEventKafkaSender.java` is still too large to be parsed. It seems that the file has more than 445 lines of code, which is the maximum number of lines that can be parsed at once.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following options:

1. **Break down the file**: You can break down the large file into smaller, manageable chunks. Each chunk can be processed separately. You can use the `read_file_lines` function to read specific lines from the file.

2. **Use a text editor**: You can use a text editor to manually edit the file and reduce its size. This can be time-consuming, but it can help you understand the structure of the file better.

3. **Refactor the code**: If possible, you can refactor the code to reduce its size. This can involve removing unnecessary comments, reducing the number of variables, or simplifying complex expressions.

4. **Use a different parser**: If the current parser is not able to handle large files, you can try using a different parser that can handle larger files more efficiently.

Please try one of these options and let me know if you still need help.
