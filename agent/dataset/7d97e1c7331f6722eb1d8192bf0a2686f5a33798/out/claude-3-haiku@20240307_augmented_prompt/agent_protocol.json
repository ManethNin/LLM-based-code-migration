The issue seems to be more complex than I initially thought. \n\nInstead of trying to patch the existing code, the best approach would be to update the project to use the new version of the `jcabi-aspects` library. This will likely require more extensive changes to the codebase, but it's the most reliable way to resolve the compilation error.\n\nHere's a high-level outline of the steps I would suggest:\n\n1. Update the `jcabi-aspects` dependency in the `pom.xml` file to the new version (0.25.1).\n2. Identify all the places in the codebase where the `@Tv` annotation is used and update them to use the new fully qualified name `com.jcabi.aspects.Tv`.\n3. Compile the project and address any other compilation errors that arise due to the dependency update.\n4. Run the test suite and address any test failures.\n\nThis approach may take more time and effort, but it's the best way to ensure the project is compatible with the new version of the `jcabi-aspects` library. Let me know if you have any other questions or if you'd like me to provide a more detailed example of the changes required.",
