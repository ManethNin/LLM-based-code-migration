Updated the `FilterBuilder` usage in the `ClasspathScanner` class to use the `includePackage` method instead of the deprecated `include(FilterBuilder.prefix(\"com.thoughtworks.gauge\"))` method.\n\nThe `include(FilterBuilder.prefix(\"com.thoughtworks.gauge\"))` method was deprecated in the newer version of the `Reflections` library, so I replaced it with the `includePackage(\"com.thoughtworks.gauge\")` method to achieve the same functionality.\n\nThis should fix the compilation errors related to the `apply` method not being found in the `org.reflections.util.FilterBuilder` class.",
