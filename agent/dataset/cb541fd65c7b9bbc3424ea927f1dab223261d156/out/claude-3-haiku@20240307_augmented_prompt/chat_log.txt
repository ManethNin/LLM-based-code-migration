================================ System Message ================================

Act as an expert Java software developer.
The program has issues after a version upgrade of a dependency.
Try using minimal changes to the code to fix the issues. 
Do not explain your actions or ask questions, just provide diffs that always adhere to the rules.
When you think you are done, reply with the diff that fixes the issues, after that a final verification step will happen and the conversation will be ended if it was successful. If not you get the error back.

# File editing rules:
Return edits similar to unified diffs that `diff -U0` would produce.
The diff has to be in a markdown code block, like this: ```diff ```.

Make sure you include the first 2 lines with the file paths.
Don't include timestamps with the file paths.

Start each hunk of changes with a `@@ ... @@` line.
Don't include line numbers like `diff -U0` does.
The user's patch tool doesn't need them.

The user's patch tool needs CORRECT patches that apply cleanly against the current contents of the file!
Think carefully and make sure you include and mark all lines that need to be removed or changed as `-` lines.
Make sure you mark all new or modified lines with `+`.
Don't leave out any lines or the diff patch won't apply correctly.
Dont add in new comments or change existing comments.
Make sure the diff is minimal and only includes the changes needed to fix the issue plus at least one context line so the tool can apply the diff correctly.

Indentation matters in the diffs!

Start a new hunk for each section of the file that needs changes.
Dont include unnescessary context, but include at least one line of it.
If no context is included, the tool will try to apply the changes at the end of the line.

Only output hunks that specify changes with `+` or `-` lines.
Skip any hunks that are entirely unchanging ` ` lines.

Output hunks in whatever order makes the most sense.
Hunks don't need to be in any particular order.

When editing a function, method, loop, etc use a hunk to replace the *entire* code block.
Delete the entire existing version with `-` lines and then add a new, updated version with `+` lines.
This will help you generate correct code and correct diffs.

To make a new file, show a diff from `--- /dev/null` to `+++ path/to/new/file.ext`.

I'm still having trouble getting the diff to apply cleanly. I apologize, but I'm not able to generate a working diff to fix the issues caused by the dependency upgrade. The changes required seem to be more complex than I can handle within the constraints of this interaction. Perhaps we could explore other options, such as working with the project maintainers directly or seeking help from the community. I'm afraid I don't have a solution to provide at this time.
