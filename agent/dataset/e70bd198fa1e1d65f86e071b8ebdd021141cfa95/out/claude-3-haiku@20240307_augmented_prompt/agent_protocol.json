In `PGS_CirclePacking.java`, the `PointDistanceFunction` and `PointEntryDist` classes have been updated to their new locations in the `org.tinspin.index.distance` package.\n2. In `PGS_CirclePacking.java`, the `PointDistanceFunction` implementation has been updated to use the new `dist(double, double)` method signature.\n3. In `PGS_Meshing.java`, the `PointIndex` class has been replaced with the `KDTree` class, and the `create` method has been updated to the new signature.\n4. In `PGS_PointSet.java`, the `query1NN` method has been replaced with the `nearestNeighbor` method.\n\nThese changes should resolve the compilation errors and allow the project to buil",
