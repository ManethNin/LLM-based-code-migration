================================ System Message ================================

Act as an expert Java software developer.
The program has issues after a version upgrade of a dependency.
Try using minimal changes to the code to fix the issues. 
Do not explain your actions or ask questions, just provide diffs that always adhere to the rules.
When you think you are done, reply with the diff that fixes the issues, after that a final verification step will happen and the conversation will be ended if it was successful. If not you get the error back.

# File editing rules:
Return edits similar to unified diffs that `diff -U0` would produce.
The diff has to be in a markdown code block, like this: ```diff ```.

Make sure you include the first 2 lines with the file paths.
Don't include timestamps with the file paths.

Start each hunk of changes with a `@@ ... @@` line.
Don't include line numbers like `diff -U0` does.
The user's patch tool doesn't need them.

The user's patch tool needs CORRECT patches that apply cleanly against the current contents of the file!
Think carefully and make sure you include and mark all lines that need to be removed or changed as `-` lines.
Make sure you mark all new or modified lines with `+`.
Don't leave out any lines or the diff patch won't apply correctly.
Dont add in new comments or change existing comments.
Make sure the diff is minimal and only includes the changes needed to fix the issue plus at least one context line so the tool can apply the diff correctly.

Indentation matters in the diffs!

Start a new hunk for each section of the file that needs changes.
Dont include unnescessary context, but include at least one line of it.
If no context is included, the tool will try to apply the changes at the end of the line.

Only output hunks that specify changes with `+` or `-` lines.
Skip any hunks that are entirely unchanging ` ` lines.

Output hunks in whatever order makes the most sense.
Hunks don't need to be in any particular order.

When editing a function, method, loop, etc use a hunk to replace the *entire* code block.
Delete the entire existing version with `-` lines and then add a new, updated version with `+` lines.
This will help you generate correct code and correct diffs.

To make a new file, show a diff from `--- /dev/null` to `+++ path/to/new/file.ext`.

The changes made in this diff address the compilation errors caused by the version upgrade of the `org.tinspin:tinspin-indexes` dependency:

1. In `PGS_CirclePacking.java`, the `PointDistanceFunction` and `PointEntryDist` classes have been updated to their new locations in the `org.tinspin.index.distance` package.
2. In `PGS_CirclePacking.java`, the `PointDistanceFunction` implementation has been updated to use the new `dist(double, double)` method signature.
3. In `PGS_Meshing.java`, the `PointIndex` class has been replaced with the `KDTree` class, and the `create` method has been updated to the new signature.
4. In `PGS_PointSet.java`, the `query1NN` method has been replaced with the `nearestNeighbor` method.

The diff you provided still does not apply cleanly to the source files. The error message indicates that the lines in the source files do not match the expected lines in the diff. Please review the error message carefully and make sure that the diff you provide includes all necessary changes, including any blank lines, comments, or other context that may be required for the diff to apply correctly.
