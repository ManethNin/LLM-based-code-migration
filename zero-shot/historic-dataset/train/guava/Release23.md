# Guava Release 23.0: Release Notes

## API Changes

- Java 8: [Full JDiff Report](http://google.github.io/guava/releases/23.0/api/diffs/) of changes since release 22.0.
- Android: [Full JDiff Report](http://google.github.io/guava/releases/23.0-android/api/diffs/) of changes since release 22.0.

## Significant API additions and changes

### common.collect

- `ContiguousSet`: new convenience methods for closed or closed-open sets of `Integer`s or `Long`s
- `Set<Set<E>> Sets.combinations(Set<E> set, int size)`: returns all subsets of the given set that have the given size

### common.graph

- New types: `SuccessorsFunction`/`PredecessorsFunction`
  - These interfaces are each supertypes of `Graph`/`ValueGraph`/`Network`. They have a few purposes:
    - scaffolding for migrating the capabilities of `TreeTraverser` into `common.graph`
    - facilitating users using their own graph data structures (when they donâ€™t need the full `common.graph` API)
- New methods on `Network` for the case when there is known to be at most one edge connecting two nodes
  - `java.util.Optional<E> edgeConnecting(N nodeU, N nodeV)`: Java 8 version only
  - `E edgeConnectingOrNull(N nodeU, N nodeV)`: all versions
- New method for `Graph`/`ValueGraph`/`Network`
  - `boolean hasEdgeConnecting(N nodeU, N nodeV)`: this is the preferred mechanism for determining whether there is an edge that connects two nodes
- Changes to methods for accessing edge values in `ValueGraph`
  - old method: `V edgeValue(N nodeU, N nodeV)`, throws `IllegalArgumentException` if no such edge exists
  - new method (Java 8 only): `java.util.Optional<V> edgeValue(N nodeU, N nodeV)`, returns `Optional.empty()` if no such edge exists
  - (no change to `@Nullable V edgeValueOrDefault(N nodeU, N nodeV, @Nullable V defaultValue)`) (Java 7 & 8)

### common.hash

- `BloomFilter`
  - is now thread-safe
  - added `Collector`s for creating a `BloomFilter` from the contents of a `Stream`
- `PrimitiveSink`, `Hasher` and `HashFunction`: methods added to all for putting/hashing `ByteBuffer`s

### common.util.concurrent

- New type: `FluentFuture`
  - A `ListenableFuture` that supports fluent chains of operations
- `AbstractFuture` has been retrofitted to extend the new `FluentFuture` type. If you subclass `AbstractFuture` to add fluent methods like `transform()`, this may break you. If so, please [report the problem](https://github.com/google/guava/issues).
- `Futures`: new methods `scheduleAsync(AsyncCallable, long, TimeUnit, ScheduledExecutorService)` and `submitAsync(AsyncCallable, Executor)`
